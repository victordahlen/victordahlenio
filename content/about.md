This is a personal website of mine that's much like a hobby project where I publish coding projects and other things. The website is built with the open source project [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio). My plan is to link to projects within data science such as ML solutions as well as data projects. I might publish some stuff related to finance as well as fitness.
